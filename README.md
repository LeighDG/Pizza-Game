# Portfolio
This is a repository of a few projects I have worked on in my free time.
I work on these projects to not only try and learn new skills, but to also implement my learnings from university.

I have a passion for software engineering, and once I get invovled in a project it becomes all I can think about.
I enjoy finding problems and spending time finding solutions to those problems.
